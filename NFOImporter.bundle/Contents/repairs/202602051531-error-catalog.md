## Error Details

### NFO-01: Function 'Start' Not Found

- **Source**: `sandbox.py:298` (Plex Framework)
- **Count**: 1
- **Template**: `Function named 'Start' couldn't be found in the current environment`
- **What happens**: When Plex loads the NFOImporter plugin, it tries to call the `Start()` function defined in the plugin's `__init__.py`. The function was not found, meaning either:
  1. The plugin's `__init__.py` doesn't define a `Start()` function
  2. The plugin failed to load (syntax error, import error) before `Start()` could be registered
  3. The plugin was designed without a `Start()` function (some utility plugins don't need one)
- **Impact**: LOW if the plugin is functioning correctly otherwise (NFO importing still works). The `Start()` function is typically used for one-time initialization at plugin load.
- **Note**: This same error also appears for `localmedia` (a built-in Plex agent), suggesting it may be a benign framework behavior for certain plugin types.

## Priority Actions

1. **Check if NFOImporter defines Start()** — Read `NFOImporter.bundle/Contents/Code/__init__.py` and check for a `def Start()` function. If absent, this error is by design and can be ignored.
2. **Verify NFO importing works** — If NFO files are being imported correctly, this error has no functional impact and can be classified as noise.
