# Root Cleanup - 2026-02-08 11:31:08 PST

## Goal
Remove development artifacts from repository root and keep generated outputs in the `repairs` reporting area.

## Phase Plan And Progress

### Phase 1 - Inventory root artifacts
- What: Check root directory and git status for generated analysis outputs.
- Why this supports the goal: Prevents moving source files by mistake and targets only artifacts.
- Output if operating correctly: Confirmed list of root-level generated files.
- Status: Completed.
- Result:
  - Identified root artifact: `consolidated_plex_logs_20260206_073809.txt`.

### Phase 2 - Relocate artifact to reporting location
- What: Move root aggregate log into `repairs/progress`.
- Why this supports the goal: Keeps generated diagnostics grouped under project repair artifacts.
- Output if operating correctly: No root `consolidated_plex_logs_*.txt` files remain.
- Status: Completed.
- Result:
  - Moved to: `repairs/progress/consolidated_plex_logs_20260206_073809.txt`.

### Phase 3 - Prevent future root clutter
- What: Add root-only ignore rule for generated consolidated logs.
- Why this supports the goal: Ensures repeated aggregation runs do not reintroduce root artifacts.
- Output if operating correctly: `.gitignore` includes `/consolidated_plex_logs_*.txt`.
- Status: Completed.
- Result:
  - Updated: `.gitignore`.

## Verification
- Root directory no longer contains `consolidated_plex_logs_*.txt` files.
