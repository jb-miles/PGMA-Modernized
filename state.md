decisions:
  - date: "2026-02-05"
    decision: "Scope: catalog errors for all gay adult agents"
    rationale: "User requested comprehensive error cataloging"
  - date: "2026-02-05"
    decision: "GayAdultFilms model errors are self-healing, deprioritized"
    rationale: "Contributing agents create models on successful write; fixing AEBN/GEVI will cascade"
  - date: "2026-02-05"
    decision: "Fix GEVI date parsing bug (item vs items variable)"
    rationale: "All 3 date range branches used wrong variable and wrong slice lengths"
  - date: "2026-02-05"
    decision: "Make AEBN studio mismatch a soft warning (score=86) instead of hard skip"
    rationale: "221 errors from production vs distribution studio name mismatches; title+date+duration still valid"

blockers:
  - "Plex plugin restart needed for all new fixes to take effect"

handoff:
  summary: "All fixes deployed to Plex. AEBN studio match softened (score=86 fallback). Title substring fallback in AEBN + 4 agents. GEVI date parsing fixed. Need restart + scan to validate."
  next_actions:
    - "Restart Plex plugins (or restart PMS)"
    - "Trigger a metadata refresh on a few items to exercise the fixes"
    - "Wait ~24h then re-run log analysis to compare error counts"
