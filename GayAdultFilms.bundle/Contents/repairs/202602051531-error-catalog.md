## Summary

GayAdultFilms has the **highest error count of any agent** (128) but only 1 unique agent-specific error type. 122 of 128 errors are "Cannot read model". The remaining 6 are infrastructure startup noise.

| Error ID | Count | Severity | Category | Actionable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GAF-01 | 122 | ERROR | Model not initialized | Self-healing |
| INFRA-01 | 3 | ERROR | Resource hash HTTP 404 | Ignore |
| INFRA-02 | 3 | CRITICAL | Resource hash exception | Ignore |

## Root Cause Analysis

**This is NOT metadata corruption.** GayAdultFilms is an intentional **coordinator agent** — a stub primary_provider whose `update()` method does nothing. All actual metadata writing is done by 22 contributing agents (AEBN, GEVI, HFGPM, etc.) via shared `utils.updateMetadata()`.

The error lifecycle:
1. Item is matched to GayAdultFilms (search always returns score=85)
2. Plex calls GayAdultFilms.update() → does nothing, model never created
3. Contributing agents run → they write metadata → model gets created
4. **First refresh**: "Cannot read model" fires (model doesn't exist yet)
5. **Second refresh**: model exists from step 3 → no error

The 122 errors represent items where:
- The model hasn't been populated by a contributing agent yet, OR
- All contributing agents failed (e.g., AEBN title match failures prevent metadata from being written)

**These errors will self-heal** as contributing agent fixes land (especially AEBN title matching, which accounts for 89 errors). As contributing agents succeed more often, they create models, and subsequent refreshes won't error.

## Error Details

### GAF-01: Cannot Read Model

- **Source**: `model.py:205` (Plex Framework)
- **Count**: 122
- **Template**: `Cannot read model from .../Metadata/Movies/.../com.plexapp.agents.GayAdultFilms`
- **Severity**: ERROR (non-blocking — contributing agents still run)
- **Self-healing**: Yes — once any contributing agent writes metadata, the error resolves for that item

---

## Priority Actions

1. **No immediate code change needed** — errors are self-healing
2. **Fix contributing agents first** — AEBN title matching (89 errors) and GEVI IndexErrors (6 errors) will indirectly reduce this count
3. **Optional future improvement** — add minimal metadata writing to GayAdultFilms.update() (set title/year from media object) to prevent the one-time first-scan error
4. **Monitor** — re-scan logs after contributing agent fixes are validated to confirm count reduction
